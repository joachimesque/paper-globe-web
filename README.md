# PaperGlobe-Web ðŸª„ðŸ—º

PaperGlobe-Web is a web app that wraps [PaperGlobe](https://github.com/joachimesque/paper-globe), so you can transform an image of the Earth to a template that you can cut and assemble by yourself.

Of course youâ€™re not limited to the Earth, you can use any other planet or quasi-spherical object as a source, as long as its surface is projected in the correct way. The image of the planet must be a cylindrical projection. Right now it works with [Equirectangular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equirectangular_projection), [Mercator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection) or [Gall stereographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gall_stereographic_projection) projections. PaperGlobe could work with any other projection, but the results wonâ€™t make you happy.
